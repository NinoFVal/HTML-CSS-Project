                <h3>Hatha Yoga</h3>
                <p class="indent"> Hatha Yoga is one of the most traditional and widely practised forms of yoga. The
                    word "hatha" is
                    derived from two Sanskrit words: "ha," which means sun, and "that," which means moon. It represents
                    the union of opposites, balancing the masculine and feminine energies within the body.</p>

                <p> Hatha Yoga primarily focuses on physical postures (asanas) and breath control
                    (pranayama) to
                    align, strengthen, and purify the body and mind. It is an excellent starting point for beginners
                    because it offers a foundation for other yoga styles and provides a gentle introduction to yoga
                    practice.</p>

                <p class="indent">
                    Hatha Yoga is not only beneficial for physical health but also for mental and
                    emotional
                    well-being. Regular practice can lead to increased flexibility, strength, and balance, as well as
                    reduced stress
                    and anxiety.</p>

            <section class="vinyasa">
                <h3>Vinyasa Yoga</h3>
                <p class="indent"> Vinyasa Yoga is a dynamic and flowing style of yoga that emphasizes the coordination
                    of breath with
                    movement. The word "Vinyasa" comes from the Sanskrit words "vi," which means variation, and "nyasa,"
                    which means within prescribed parameters.</p>

                <p> In Vinyasa Yoga, practitioners move through a series of poses in a smooth and
                    continuous sequence, with each movement linked to the breath.</p>

                <p class="indent">
                    Vinyasa Yoga classes can range from gentle and relaxing to vigorous and physically
                    demanding, depending on the instructor's style and the level of the class. It is a popular choice
                    for those who
                    enjoy movement, variety, and a more energetic approach to yoga.</p>

                <p> Whether you're looking to build strength, increase flexibility, reduce stress, or
                    simply enjoy the flow of movement, Vinyasa Yoga offers a dynamic and transformative practice
                    suitable for
                    practitioners of all levels.</p><br>

            <section class="ashtanga">
                <h3>Ashtanga Yoga</h3>
                <p class="indent"> Ashtanga is a vigorous and structured form of yoga that follows a specific sequence
                    of postures. It
                    involves synchronized breathing, and practitioners progress through the series at their own
                    pace.</p><br>

                <p>
                <h4>Tristhana</h4> Ashtanga Yoga emphasizes three focal points during practice known as Tristhana.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                <h5>Breath (Pranayama)</h5> Ujjayi breath, a deep and audible breath, is used throughout the practice
                to create internal heat and aid concentration.</p><br>
                <p>
                <h5>Posture (Asana)</h5> Ashtanga follows a specific sequence of postures, which are organized into
                six series.The primary series (Yoga Chikitsa) is the first series and focuses on building a
                strong foundation. The practice then progresses to more challenging series as the practitioner becomes
                more proficient.</p><br>
                <p>
                <h5>Gaze (Drishti)</h5> Each asana has a specific gazing point (Drishti), which helps to focus the
                mind and improve concentration during the practice.</p><br>

            <section class="yin">
                <h3>Yin Yoga</h3>
                <p class="indent"> Yin Yoga is a slow-paced and gentle style of yoga that targets the deep connective
                    tissues of the
                    body, such as ligaments, tendons, and fascia. Unlike more dynamic and active styles of yoga.</p>

                <p>
                    Yin Yoga involves holding passive postures for an extended period, typically ranging
                    from 3 to 5 minutes
                    or even longer. The extended holds allow the muscles to relax, enabling the practitioner to access
                    deeper layers of the body.</p>

                <p class="indent"> Yin Yoga is not about achieving extreme flexibility or pushing the body to its
                    limits. Instead, it
                    encourages practitioners to explore their physical and emotional edges with a sense of acceptance
                    and patience. The practice can lead to increased flexibility, improved joint health, and a sense of
                    inner peace.</p>

                <p>
                    Because Yin Yoga focuses on stillness and holding poses for an extended time, it can
                    be a deeply restorative and calming practice. It is often recommended as a complement to more active
                    forms of
                    yoga or other physical activities, providing balance and harmony to the body and mind.</p><br>

            <section class="power">
                <h3>Power Yoga</h3>
                <p class="indent">
                    Power yoga is a dynamic and physically challenging style that is based on the Ashtanga tradition but
                    without a strict set sequence. It often includes strength-building exercises and vigorous
                    movements.</p>

                <p>
                    Power Yoga is a dynamic and vigorous style of yoga that draws inspiration from Ashtanga Yoga, but it
                    doesn't strictly adhere to a fixed sequence of poses. Power Yoga is characterized by its focus on
                    strength-building, intensity, and fluid movements, making it an excellent choice for individuals
                    seeking a challenging and physically demanding practice.</p>

                <p class="indent">
                    Power Yoga is a challenging and empowering practice that can help practitioners develop physical
                    strength, flexibility, and mental focus. It can also be an effective way to manage stress and
                    cultivate a sense of presence and mindfulness.</p>
